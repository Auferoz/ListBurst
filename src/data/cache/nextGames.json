Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, Avyanna’s rule begins to crack. Allies disappear and abandon her. An unknown force spreads strife and madness through her realm.\n\nThe choice is yours – shape the future, for salvation or ruin. As you chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic and lurking conspiracies infecting your rotting empire, you’ll face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes. Uncover the long-lost Mountain Clans, witness the rise of an ancient cult and confront a corrupted seer whose visions have awoken bitter grudges, while old enemies are on the rise.\n\nIt will take all your courage to save Nevendaar. Are you brave enough to face – and embrace – its darkest truths?",

        "summary": "Latest ultra-violent sci-fi action title from Grasshopper Manufacture and Suda51.\n\nStep into the blood-soaked boots of Romeo Stargazer, a man pulled back from the brink of death by a time paradox gone wrong. Now reborn as Agent Dead Man of the FBI Space-Time Division, and armed with the mysterious Dead Gear mask, Romeo must chase the universe’s most dangerous fugitives across alternate realities.\n\nBlending high-octane gunplay, brutal sword combat, and over-the-top sci-fi insanity, Romeo Is a Dead Man is GhM’s bloodiest action game yet. Players can expect mind-bending twists, outrageous gimmicks, and a deeply cathartic combat system that turns enemies’ powers against them in universe-shattering battles.\n\nAs Romeo tears through the multiverse, he’s also on a desperate quest to find Juliet, his mysteriously vanished girlfriend. With a narrative that fuses love, loss, and metaphysical chaos, Romeo Is a Dead Man offers a stylish and unpredictable journey through the very fabric of time itself.\n\nCan you survive the bleeding edge of space-time? Or will you become just another ghost in the paradox?",

Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through crumbling caves and pools of old trash sacrificing his own well-being to save his damsel in distress – IN 3D. Super Meat Boy 3D brings the old school difficulty of classic retro titles we all know and love and streamlines them down to the essential no bull straight forward twitch reflex platforming. Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing Meat Boy will brave lush (but also on fire) forests, vast dumps filled with the waste of mankind, and high-tech forges producing the very traps that will inevitably kill Meat Boy over and over and over - IN 3D! And if a bunch of levels weren't enough, we also have epic boss fights and tons of unlockable secrets – IN 3D!",

Their tunes can revolutionize the music industry and redefine genres - but what good is a great song if no one hears it? It’s your job to land your clients a record deal and negotiate the terms on their behalf. Will you help them fight for their creative freedom, or sell them out to the industry bigwigs?\n\nCoffee and Cigarettes for Breakfast: Sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll can only get you so far. Somebody has to make sure the band is in shape to play the next gig. This is where you come in. Make sure they eat a half-decent meal every now and again, fix their gear, get them to rehearse… Hope you like herding cats!\n\nDon’t Stop Me Now: It’s your job to book the venue, finalize the setlist and ensure the gig goes according to the plan. Each successful performance is a step toward fame and glory. Sure, that “club” was just a grimy basement, and the audience barely outnumbered the band - but even rock legends have to start somewhere, right?",
